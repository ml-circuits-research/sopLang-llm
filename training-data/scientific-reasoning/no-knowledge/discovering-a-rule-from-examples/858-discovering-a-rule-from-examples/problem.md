# 858 — Discovering a rule from examples

Given knowledge. In the hiking model, the map shows distances and elevation changes, weather can change speed, and the team has a limited reserve of water and energy. Layered clothing reduces heat loss under the stated cold conditions. Map scale allows map distance to be converted into real distance. Climbing uses more energy in the model than walking on level ground.

Problem data. A means “there is sufficient water”, B means “the route is open”. A box applies the same unknown logical rule: A=NO, B=NO → result=NO; A=NO, B=YES → result=YES; A=YES, B=YES → result=YES. Candidates: R1=A AND B; R2=A OR B; R3=exactly one; R4=neither A nor B.

Question. Eliminate candidate rules that are incompatible with even one example. Which rule remains? Use it for the new case A=YES, B=NO.
