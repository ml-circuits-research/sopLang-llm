# 882 — Robust decision-making under uncertainty

Given knowledge. Seeds can be dispersed by wind, water, or animals. In the model, a seed reaches a new place only if it leaves the parent plant and remains capable of germinating after transport. Light seeds or seeds with wings can be carried more easily by wind. Some fruits have hooks that attach to fur.

Problem data. The real state is unknown. The following scenarios are still possible: only “the seed leaves the parent plant” is faulty, only “the seed remains viable” is faulty. Only one condition is faulty in each scenario. Actions: X repairs A, cost 1; Y repairs B, cost 1; Z repairs A, B, cost 2; W repairs A, B, C, cost 4; V repairs B, C, cost 3.

Question. Choose one action now that guarantees a repair regardless of which still-possible scenario is real. Which guaranteed action is robust and has the minimum cost?

Additional information. The faulty conditions named above carry the labels A and C.
