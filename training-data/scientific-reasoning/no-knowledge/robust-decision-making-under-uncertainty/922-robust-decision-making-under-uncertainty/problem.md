# 922 — Robust decision-making under uncertainty

Given knowledge. A lever has a fulcrum, a load, and a place where effort is applied. In the numerical model, for the same load, moving the effort farther from the fulcrum can reduce the force required. The fulcrum is the point around which the lever rotates. The effort arm is the distance between the applied effort and the fulcrum.

Problem data. The real state is unknown. The following scenarios are still possible: only “there is a fulcrum” is faulty, only “effort arm is large enough” is faulty. Only one condition is faulty in each scenario. Actions: X repairs A, cost 1; Y repairs B, cost 1; Z repairs A, B, cost 2; W repairs A, B, C, cost 4; V repairs B, C, cost 3.

Question. Choose one action now that guarantees a repair regardless of which still-possible scenario is real. Which guaranteed action is robust and has the minimum cost?

Additional information. The faulty conditions named above carry the labels A and C.
