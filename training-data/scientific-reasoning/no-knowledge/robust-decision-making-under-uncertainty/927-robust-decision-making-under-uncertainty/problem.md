# 927 — Robust decision-making under uncertainty

Given knowledge. Two gears that touch directly rotate in opposite directions. In the model, if a small gear drives a larger gear, the larger gear makes fewer rotations in the same time; an odd or even number of contacts can change the final direction. The teeth prevent slipping in the ideal model. An intermediate gear can change direction without being the useful output.

Problem data. The real state is unknown. The following scenarios are still possible: only “no part is blocked” is faulty, only “the gear ratio is appropriate” is faulty. Only one condition is faulty in each scenario. Actions: X repairs A, cost 1; Y repairs B, cost 1; Z repairs A, B, cost 2; W repairs A, B, C, cost 4; V repairs B, C, cost 3.

Question. Choose one action now that guarantees a repair regardless of which still-possible scenario is real. Which guaranteed action is robust and has the minimum cost?

Additional information. The faulty conditions named above carry the labels B and C.
